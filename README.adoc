== High-level Architecture

== Implementation

The jsAppender to push log messages over relp to a compatible relp-server with syslog envelope.

Use following components for: 

* rlp_02: RELP connection 
* rlo_08: Generate the Syslog message 
* Java-relp-server-demo: RELP compatible server (tested on) 

How to implement:

* asynchronus behaviour completely controlled by the Jasmine async works.
+
[source,node]
-----------------
npm install 
-----------------

* Module usage:
+ 
The appender uses the rlo_08 for handling formatting log messages and rlp_02 to send the log event message to the RELP Server.
+
[source,javascript]
-----------------
const { SyslogMessage, Facility, SDElement, SDParam, Severity } = require('@teragrep/rlo_08')
const { RelpConnection, RelpBatch } = require('@teragrep/rlp_02')
-----------------

* Build
+
[source,java]
-----------------
mvn clean package
-----------------

* Optional tips:
+
async waterfall method also possible for run in the node engine (need to adjust the code).

== Configuration

* `*_type_*` - `*_jsAppender_*`
* `*_hostname_*` - `*_string_*` (defaults to os.hostname()) - origin of the log messages
* `*_appname_*` - `*_string_*` 
* `*_serverAddress_*` - `*_string_*`
* `*_serverPort_*` - `*_integer_*` (defaults to 1601) - Port of the relp server is listening in


== Example (default config)
[source,javascript]
-----------------

log4js.configure( {
    appenders: {jsa: { type: jsAppender, appName: 'teragrep' },
    console: { type: 'console' },
  },
  categories: {
    jsa: { appenders: ['jsa'], level: 'error' },
    default: { appenders: ['jsa'], level: 'trace' },
  },
})
-----------------

This configuration will send the log event messages to the RELP Server.
